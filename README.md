## 🔧 Admin & Advanced

### Double Strip Printing (Admin)
If you are managing the booth and want to print the current session's double strip from a separate device (e.g., a phone connected to a printer):

1.  Ensure the session has reached the **Done** screen.
2.  Navigate to the following URL on your admin device:
    `https://res.cloudinary.com/<your-cloud-name>/image/upload/photobooth-print.png`
3.  This URL always points to the **latest** double strip generated by the booth.
4.  Print directly from your browser or save and use a printing app (like Canon SELPHY).

> [!NOTE]
> The `photobooth-print` ID is overwritten with every new session, so you only ever see the most recent capture.
